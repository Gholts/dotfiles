## About

```shell
cd dotfiles

stow -t ~/.config .
```

This repository contains my personal configuration files for development on macOS.

It's not recommended to directly copy my configs, unless you know what they mean. Google and the manual pages are your best friends when exploring the open source world.

This thing will keep getting better until I die.

If you want, you can visit my [blog](https://gholts.top/).
